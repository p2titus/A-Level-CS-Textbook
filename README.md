# Mike's A-Level CS texbook

I am writing a tex(t)book for use with A-Level CS teaching. Primarily, it is aimed at the AQA spec.

## Create a pdf
You will need `pdflatex` and `bibtex` installed. If you are running Linux, these can likely be found on your system already.

Simply navigate to the directory in the terminal and type `make` to create a human readable, beautiful looking PDF.
